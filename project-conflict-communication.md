##### Our Conflict Plan:
* In a situation where a conflict arises, we have agreed to a discussion for an areed amout of time, to be established once we have decided to mediate the conflict in this manner.   
*  If after discussion, and the conflict not resolved, we have agreed that we will vote on the issue.
*  A vote will be give on a scale of 1-5, 1 being strongly towards decision A, and 5 being strongly for decision B.    being netueal.  
* After votes, being tabulated. We will go the way of the voted decision.  
* In the event of a tie, after the voting process, we decieded to "rock, paper, sissors".
#####  Our Communication Plan
1. We areed that normal **"in-office"**  hours will be from **9:00 - 5:30**;
1. We areed that two daily gatherings will occur, **the first at 9:15am**, and the **second after lunch at 1:15**.  This will allow us to arrive around 9:00 get set-up, and  prepared to address any situations
3. At each gathering, we will discuss progress,blocking issues, and plan of attack.
4. We will make sure that everyone has a voice, by making sure we take turns in a circular manner.
5. We also have agreed, that we will communicate in slack, and attempt to be semi-active while away.  but also understand the we to have to have a work-life balance.
